      <description>In this post, I will be providing an overview on how I set up an application server to host my Python data visualization using popular frameworks like Bokeh or Dash. The server is built on Ubuntu and utilizes Nginx as a reverse proxy and Certbot for securing the connection with HTTPS.
Please note that this guide is not exhaustive or highly detailed, as it is intended for internal access and use only.</description>

      <description>Passwordless SSH logins offer a secure and efficient way to access remote servers. Unlike traditional authentication methods that rely on passwords, passwordless SSH utilizes cryptographic keys to verify your identity. This eliminates the need to constantly enter your username and password, making it faster and more convenient.
It&amp;rsquo;s widely recognized that passwords are vulnerable to hacking and brute force attacks. By using passwordless SSH, you can significantly enhance the security of your remote connections.</description>
